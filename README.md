# Demo Hierarchy Navigator For Fireeye

Two years ago I wrote a reusable general purpose react component that allowed for the browsing and selection of items in complex, multilevel hierarchies.  I had hoped to submit this as the code sample for my candidacy with FireEye. Alas, I now longer had access to that repository and could no longer locate my copy of the code.

As a result, I've spent about two days putting together, from scratch, what you see here. It is far from perfect. One thing that needs much more work is the handling of partially selected subtrees, which is not currently working and but I'm sure I could fix given another day but I would rather submit now knowing that all software is imperfect and this should serve as a decent base for evaluating my programming and software design capabilities as a candidate for a position at FireEye, which I would love to have.

What you are looking at here represents about two days of coding work - developing a real, production-quality, reusable component would take quite a bit longer

Once thing, my original version used the older class style react components.  This version is pure functional and makes use of hooks and effects

## Cloning and running the application

Once you've cloned to your local machine, be sure to checkout the master branch.  Then run 'npm install'  followed by 'npm start'.   You should then be able to see the application at http://localhost:3000

Thank you for taking the time to review the humble effort.  I would be very happy to walk you through the app and have a discussion if you like

Best,

Harry Kapsales
